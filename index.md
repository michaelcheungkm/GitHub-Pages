# Who Am I?
My name is **Michael Cheung** and I am currently a 4th year Math-CS undergraduate student at UCSD.
During my spare time, I enjoy tinkering with programs, playing games, certain sports, and cooking.

>Contains some things I have written on the side
```It is mostly a lot of Python related programs that perform miscellaneous tasks such as plotting or rankings.```

As a programmer, and being more on the maths side of things, I enjoy writing a lot of data related programs. That could be data crunching or wrangling, data collection through scraping, or data analysis. I also enjoy writing small games and solvers in my spare time, i.e. sudoku solver or tic tac toe engine.

## My Favorite Food
My favorite thing to cook is a Chinese/Taiwanese dish called Lou Rou Fan, which translates to old meat rice, and growing up was the dish I most looked forward to eating.
